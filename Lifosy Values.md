# Lifosy Values

## Ownership

Files over services is not just something we say. It's the basis for ensuring that your data always belongs to you. No matter what you do with Lifosy, you always have full control over your data. If Lifosy no longer exists, this does not mean that your data is gone.

## Access

It doesn't matter which device you use to access your data. Whether desktop or mobile, whether Windows, MacOS or Linux, whether iOS or Android. Your data, your dashboards, your widgets work the same everywhere. No favoritism.

## Simplicity

Basically, it's about editing files. This is not rocket science. Accordingly, it must be easy to edit files. Be it via the editor or via corresponding widgets.
